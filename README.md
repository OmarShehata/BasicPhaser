# BasicPhaser
This is a barebones Phaser.io project you can use to build off of. For more info about the HTML5 game framework powering this example, see: http://phaser.io/

## Getting Started

Phaser requires a web server set up. The easiest way is to set one up with Python. 

Make sure you have Python installed, and then double click the server.python3.bat (or python2 if that's the version you have) and the server will launch. You can now access the example through: 127.0.0.1:8000

Note: If you are a non-Windows user, simple open the .bat as a text file, and run the python command through the terminal to set the server up.
